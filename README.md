# Biodiversity-in-national-parks
This is one of my first data analysis projects. It seeks to interpret data from the National Park Service about species biodiversity. 

This project will identify trends in the data, and ideas for future analysis, and answer 4 main questions:

1. What is the distribution of the conservation status of the animals?
2. What is the distribution of endangered species?
3. What species were spotted most at each park?
4. Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?

Technology Used:
-Python and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.stats.
-Data Visualisation
-Jupyter Notebook

The data in this project is based on real data but to my knowledge is not real. It is provided by Codecademy.

# Key Findings 

1. What is the distribution of conservation status of the animals?

  Most of the animals had no conservation status at all.
  
2. What is the distribution of endangered species?

  Mammals and birds were the most common. There were no reptile or nonvascular plant species that were endangered in the data.

3. What species were spotted most at each park?

  The most spotted species at all of the parks were vascular plants followed by birds. Again this makes sense as they're some of the most frequent in the data. Yellowstone Park had the most number of observations.

4. Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?

  Yes, the difference between species and their conservation status is statistically significant.
